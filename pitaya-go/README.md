# Pitaya Go 

> An Open-Source IoT Development Platform with Multiprotocol Wireless Connectivity

## Description

Pitaya Go is a compact and versatile development platform for IoT solutions, combining the Nordic's high-end multiprotocol SoC [nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52840) and the Microchip's extreme low power Wi-Fi® network controller [ATWINC1500B](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATWINC1500-IC). It offers a complete solution for wireless connectivity with IEEE 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 5, Thread and Zigbee, that is specifically designed for the IoT.

Pitaya Go features a Battery Charger with power path management, 64Mbit ultra low power QSPI Flash memory, additional NFC-A Tag PCB Antenna, user programmable RGB LED and Buttons, reversible USB-C Connector and easily expandable Header Sockets. All these features above make this board an ideal choice for the next IoT project.
